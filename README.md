###Application Details and Origin

Highlands is a West Village gastropub featuring an extensive Scotch whisky list of over one hundred and eighty expressions. While Highlands has its whisky list in print, principals and clientele have sought an online version, if not a searchable one, too. weeWhisky Search will provide Highlands’ clientele with a long asked for tool.

weeWhisky is a full-stack web application designed to help malt, grain, or blended Scotch whisky drinkers search for whiskies similar to or outside of their palate’s traditional tendencies. The site will have access to a whisky database with table fields of Region, Distillery, Expression, Palate, ABV, Cask Finish and type of whisky, i.e., Single Malt, Single Grain, Blended Malt, Blended Grain and Blended Scotch Whisky. The user will be able to search the whisky database via an API using any of the data in the aforementioned fields.
